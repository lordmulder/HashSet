Introduction
============

**LibHashSet** is a simple *hash set* implementation for C99. It uses open addressing and double hashing.

At this time, the *only* type of elements (keys) supported is `uint64_t`.

This hash set implementation has been tested to *efficiently* handle several billions of items üòè


Getting Started
===============

Here is a simple example of how to use LibHashSet in your application:

```C
#include <hash_set.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	size_t offset = 0U;
	uint64_t value;

	/* create new hash set instance */
	hash_set_t *const hash_set = hash_set_create(0U, -1.0, 0U);
	if (!hash_set)
	{
		fputs("Allocation has failed!\n", stderr);
		return EXIT_FAILURE;
	}

	/* add a number of items to the hash set, the set will grow as needed */
	while (have_more_items())
	{
		const errno_t error = hash_set_insert(hash_set, get_next_item());
		if (error)
		{
			fprintf(stderr, "Insert operation has failed! (error: %d)\n", error);
			return EXIT_FAILURE;
		}
	}

	/* test whether hash set contains a specific item */
	if (hash_set_contains(hash_set, 42U) == 0)
	{
		puts("Set contains item!");

		/* remove the existing item from the hash set */
		if (hash_set_remove(hash_set, 42U) == 0)
		{
			puts("Item has been removed!");
		}
	}

	/* print total number of items in the hash set*/
	printf("Total number of items: %zu\n", hash_set_size(hash_set));

	/* print all items in the set */
	while (hash_set_iterate(hash_set, &offset, &value) == 0)
	{
		printf("Item: %016llX\n", value);
	}

	/* destroy the hash set, when it is no longer needed! */
	hash_set_destroy(hash_set);
	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```


API Reference
=============

Types
-----

### hash_set_t

A `struct` that represents a hash set instance. Instances can be allocated and de-allocated via the [hash_set_create()](#hashsetcreate) and [hash_set_destroy()](#hashsetdestroy) functions, respectively.

***Note:*** Application code shall treat this `struct` as opaque!

```C
typedef struct _hash_set hash_set_t;
```

Functions
---------

### hash_set_create()

Allocates a new hash set instance. The new hash set instance is empty initially.

```C
hash_set_t *hash_set_create(
	const size_t initial_capacity,
	const double load_factor
);
```

#### Parameters

* `initial_capacity`  
  The initial capacity of the hash set (number of items). The given value will be rounded to the next power of two. If this parameter is set to *zero*, the the *default* initial capacity is used.

* `load_factor`  
  The load factor to be used for the hash set. The given value will be clipped to the **0.1** to **1.0** range. If this parameter is less than or equal to *zero*, the recommended *default* load factor is used.

#### Return value

On success, this function returns a pointer to a new hash set instance. On error, a `NULL` pointer is returned.

***Note:*** To avoid a memory leak, the returned pointer must be de-allocated by the application using the [hash_set_destroy()](#hashsetdestroy) function, as soon as the instance is *not* needed anymore!

### hash_set_destroy()

De-allocates an existing hash set instance. All items in the hash set are discarded.

```C
void hash_set_destroy(
	hash_set_t *instance
);
```

#### Parameters

* `instance`  
  A pointer to the hash set instance that is to be destroyed, as returned by the [hash_set_create()](#hashsetcreate) function.  
  ***Note:*** The given pointer is *invalidated* by this function, and it **must not** be used afterwards!

### hash_set_insert()

Tries to insert the given value into the hash set. The operation fails, if the set already contains the given value.

***Note:*** If the value is actually inserted, then the hash set *may* need to grow.

```C
errno_t hash_set_insert(
	hash_set_t *const instance,
	const uint64_t value
);
```

#### Parameters

* `instance`  
  A pointer to the hash set instance to be modified, as returned by the [hash_set_create()](#hashsetcreate) function.

* `value`  
  The value (key) to be inserted into the hash set. It can be *any* value in the `0U` to `UINT64_MAX` range.

#### Return value

On success, this function returns *zero*. On error, the appropriate error code is returned. Possible error codes include:

* `EINVAL`  
  An invalid argument was given, e.g. `instance` was set to `NULL`.

* `EEXIST`  
  The given value (key) was *not* inserted into the hash set (again), because that value was already present.

* `ENOMEM`  
  The value could *not* be inserted, because the required amount of memory could *not* be allocated.

* `EFAULT`  
  Something else went wrong. This usually indicates an internal error and is *not* supposed to happen.

### hash_set_remove()

Tries to remove the given value from the hash set. The operation fails, if the set does *not* contain the given value.

***Note:*** If the value is actually removed, then the hash set *may* shrink.

```C
errno_t hash_set_remove(
	hash_set_t *const instance,
	const uint64_t value
);
```

#### Parameters

* `instance`  
  A pointer to the hash set instance to be modified, as returned by the [hash_set_create()](#hashsetcreate) function.

* `value`  
  The value (key) to be removed from the hash set. It can be *any* value in the `0U` to `UINT64_MAX` range.

#### Return value

On success, this function returns *zero*. On error, the appropriate error code is returned. Possible error codes include:

* `EINVAL`  
  An invalid argument was given, e.g. `instance` was set to `NULL`.

* `ENOENT`  
  The given value (key) could *not* be removed from the hash set, because *no* such value was present.

* `EFAULT`  
  Something else went wrong. This usually indicates an internal error and is *not* supposed to happen.

### hash_set_clear()

Discards *all* items from the hash set at once.

```C
errno_t hash_set_clear(
	hash_set_t *const instance
);
```
#### Parameters

* `instance`  
  A pointer to the hash set instance to be modified, as returned by the [hash_set_create()](#hashsetcreate) function.

#### Return value

On success, this function returns *zero*. On error, the appropriate error code is returned. Possible error codes include:

* `EINVAL`  
  An invalid argument was given, e.g. `instance` was set to `NULL`.

* `EAGAIN`  
  The hash set was *not* cleared, because it already was empty. Please try again later!

* `EFAULT`  
  Something else went wrong. This usually indicates an internal error and is *not* supposed to happen.

### hash_set_contains()

Tests whether the hash set contains a specific value. The operation fails, if the set does *not* contain the given value.

```C
errno_t hash_set_contains(
	const hash_set_t *const instance,
	const uint64_t value
);
```

#### Parameters

* `instance`  
  A pointer to the hash set instance to be examined, as returned by the [hash_set_create()](#hashsetcreate) function.

* `value`  
  The value (key) to be searched in the hash set. It can be *any* value in the `0U` to `UINT64_MAX` range.

#### Return value

On success, this function returns *zero*. On error, the appropriate error code is returned. Possible error codes include:

* `EINVAL`  
  An invalid argument was given, e.g. `instance` was set to `NULL`.

* `ENOENT`  
  The hash set does *not* contain the specified value (key).

* `EFAULT`  
  Something else went wrong. This usually indicates an internal error and is *not* supposed to happen.

### hash_set_iterate()

```C
errno_t hash_set_iterate(
	const hash_set_t *const instance,
	size_t *const offset,
	uint64_t *const value
);
```

### hash_set_size()

```C
size_t hash_set_size(
	const hash_set_t *const instance
);
```

### hash_set_info()

```C
errno_t hash_set_info(
	const hash_set_t *const instance,
	size_t *const capacity,
	size_t *const valid,
	size_t *const deleted,
	size_t *const limit
);
```

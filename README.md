Introduction
============

**LibHashSet** is a [*hash set*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) and [*hash map*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) implementation for C99. It uses open addressing and double hashing.

At this time, the *only* types of elements supported are `uint16_t`, `uint32_t` and `uint64_t`.

This hash set implementation has successfully been tested to *efficiently* handle several billions of items üòè


Getting Started
===============

Here is a simple example of how to use LibHashSet in your application:

```C
#include <hash_set.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	uint64_t item;
	uintptr_t cursor = 0U;

	/* create new hash set instance */
	hash_set64_t* const hash_set = hash_set_create64(0U, -1.0, 42U);
	if (!hash_set)
	{
		fputs("Allocation has failed!\n", stderr);
		return EXIT_FAILURE;
	}

	/* add a number of items to the hash set, the set will grow as needed */
	puts("Insertign items, please wait...");
	while (have_more_items())
	{
		const errno_t error = hash_set_insert64(hash_set, get_next_item());
		if (error)
		{
			fprintf(stderr, "Insert operation has failed! (error: %d)\n", error);
			return EXIT_FAILURE;
		}
	}
	puts("Done.\n");

	/* print total number of items in the hash set*/
	printf("Total number of items: %zu\n\n", hash_set_size64(hash_set));

	/* print all items in the set */
	while (hash_set_iterate64(hash_set, &cursor, &item) == 0)
	{
		printf("Item: %016llX\n", item);
	}

	/* destroy the hash set, when it is no longer needed! */
	hash_set_destroy64(hash_set);
	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```


API Reference
=============

This section describes the LibHashSet programming interface. The functions for managing *hash sets* are declared in `<hash_set.h>`, whereas the functions for managing to *hash maps* are declared in `<hash_map.h>`.

LibHashSet supports sets and maps containing elements of different integral types. For each element type, separate functions are provided. The functions for `uint16_t`, `uint32_t` and `uint64_t` can be distinguished by the suffix `‚Ä¶16`, `‚Ä¶32` and `‚Ä¶64`, respectively. In the following, the functions are described in their "generic" form.

***Note:*** On Microsoft Windows (Visual C++), when using LibHashSet as a "shared" library (DLL file), the macro `HASHSET_DLL` must be defined *before* including the `<hash_set.h>` or `<hash_map.h>` header files!

Types
-----

### hash_set_t

A `struct` that represents a LibHashSet *hash set* instance. Hash set instances can be allocated and de-allocated via the [hash_set_create()](#hash_set_create) and [hash_set_destroy()](#hash_set_destroy) functions, respectively.

***Note:*** Application code shall treat this `struct` as opaque. The internals may change in future versions!

```C
typedef struct _hash_set hash_set_t;
```

### hash_map_t

A `struct` that represents a LibHashSet *hash map* instance. Hash map instances can be allocated and de-allocated via the [hash_map_create()](#hash_map_create) and [hash_map_destroy()](#hash_map_destroy) functions, respectively.

***Note:*** Application code shall treat this `struct` as opaque! The internals may change in future versions!

```C
typedef struct _hash_map hash_map_t;
```

Globals
-------

### Version information

The *major*, *minor* and *patch* version of the LibHashSet library:

```C
extern const uint16_t HASHSET_VERSION_MAJOR;
extern const uint16_t HASHSET_VERSION_MINOR;
extern const uint16_t HASHSET_VERSION_PATCH;
```

### Build information

The build *date* and *time* of the LibHashSet library:

```C
extern const char *const HASHSET_BUILD_DATE;
extern const char *const HASHSET_BUILD_TIME;
```

Set Functions
-------------

This section describes all functions for managing `hash_set_t` instances.

### hash_set_create()

Allocates a new hash set instance. The new hash set instance is empty initially.

```C
hash_set_t *hash_set_create(
	const size_t initial_capacity,
	const double load_factor,
	const uint32_t seed
);
```

#### Parameters

* `initial_capacity`  
  The initial capacity of the hash set (number of items). The given count will be rounded to the next power of two. If the number of items to be inserted into the hash set can be estimated beforehand, then the initial capacity should be adjusted accordingly to avoid unnecessary re-allocations. In any case, the hash set will be able to grow dynamically as needed. If this parameter is set to *zero*, the the *default* initial capacity (8192) is used.

* `load_factor`  
  The load factor to be applied to the hash set. The given load factor will be clipped to the **0.1** to **1.0** range. Generally, the default load factor (0.8) offers a good trade-off between performance and memory usage. Higher load factors decrease the memory overhead, but also may increase the time required for insert, lookup and remove operations. If this parameter is less than or equal to *zero*, the *default* load factor is used.

* `seed`  
  The "seed" value that is used to tweak the internal hash computation. The application should set this parameter to a value that is hard to predict and that is unlikely to repeat (e.g., a high-resolution timer is suitable here).

#### Return value

On success, this function returns a pointer to a new hash set instance. On error, a `NULL` pointer is returned.

***Note:*** To avoid a memory leak, the returned pointer must be de-allocated by the application using the [hash_set_destroy()](#hash_set_destroy) function, as soon as the instance is *not* needed anymore!

### hash_set_destroy()

De-allocates an existing hash set instance. All items in the hash set are discarded.

```C
void hash_set_destroy(
	hash_set_t *instance
);
```

#### Parameters

* `instance`  
  A pointer to the hash set instance that is to be destroyed, as returned by the [hash_set_create()](#hash_set_create) function.  
  ***Note:*** The given pointer is *invalidated* by this function, and it **must not** be used afterwards!

### hash_set_insert()

Tries to insert the given item into the hash set. The operation fails, if the set already contains the given item.

***Note:*** If the item is actually inserted, then the hash set *may* need to grow.

```C
errno_t hash_set_insert(
	hash_set_t *const instance,
	const value_t item
);
```

#### Parameters

* `instance`  
  A pointer to the hash set instance to be modified, as returned by the [hash_set_create()](#hash_set_create) function.

* `item`  
  The item to be inserted into the hash set.

#### Return value

On success, this function returns *zero*. On error, the appropriate error code is returned. Possible error codes include:

* `EINVAL`  
  An invalid argument was given, e.g. `instance` was set to `NULL`.

* `EEXIST`  
  The given item was *not* inserted into the hash set (again), because it was already present.

* `ENOMEM`  
  The item could *not* be inserted, because the required amount of memory could *not* be allocated.

* `EFAULT`  
  Something else went wrong. This usually indicates an internal error and is *not* supposed to happen.

### hash_set_remove()

Tries to remove the given item from the hash set. The operation fails, if the set does *not* contain the given item.

***Note:*** If the item is actually removed, then the hash set *may* shrink.

```C
errno_t hash_set_remove(
	hash_set_t *const instance,
	const value_t item
);
```

#### Parameters

* `instance`  
  A pointer to the hash set instance to be modified, as returned by the [hash_set_create()](#hash_set_create) function.

* `item`  
  The item to be removed from the hash set.

#### Return value

On success, this function returns *zero*. On error, the appropriate error code is returned. Possible error codes include:

* `EINVAL`  
  An invalid argument was given, e.g. `instance` was set to `NULL`.

* `ENOENT`  
  The given item could *not* be removed from the hash set, because *no* such item was present.

* `EFAULT`  
  Something else went wrong. This usually indicates an internal error and is *not* supposed to happen.

### hash_set_clear()

Discards *all* items from the hash set at once.

```C

	hash_set_t *const instance
);
```
#### Parameters

* `instance`  
  A pointer to the hash set instance to be modified, as returned by the [hash_set_create()](#hash_set_create) function.

* `EAGAIN`  
  The hash set was *not* cleared, because it already was empty. Please try again later!

* `EFAULT`  
  Something else went wrong. This usually indicates an internal error and is *not* supposed to happen.

### hash_set_contains()

Tests whether the hash set contains an item. The operation fails, if the set does *not* contain the given item.

```C
errno_t hash_set_contains(
	const hash_set_t *const instance,
	const value_t item
);
```

#### Parameters

### hash_set_iterate()

Iterates through the items stored in the hash set. The elements are iterated in **no** particular order.

This function returns one item at a time. It should be called *repeatedly*, until the end of the set is encountered.

***Warning:*** The result is *undefined*, if the set is modified while the iteration is in progress!

```C
errno_t hash_set_iterate(
	const hash_set_t *const instance,

  This variable **must** be initialized to the value `0U`, by the calling application, prior to the the *first* invocation!  
  Each invocation will update the value of `*cursor`. This value **shall not** be altered by the application.

* `item`  
  A pointer to a variable of type `value_t` where the next item in the set is stored on success.  
  The content of the variable should be considered *undefined*, if the invocation has failed.

    - `'u'` &ndash; the slot is *unused*
    - `'v'` &ndash; the slot is *valid*
    - `'d'` &ndash; the slot is *deleted*

  * `key`  
    The key that is stored at the current "slot" index.

  * `value`  
    The value that is stored at the current "slot" index.

  ##### Return value

  If the function returns a *non-zero* value, the iteration continues; otherwise it is cancelled.

#### Return value

On success, this function returns *zero*. On error, the appropriate error code is returned. Possible error codes include:

* `EINVAL`  
  An invalid argument was given, e.g. `instance` was map to `NULL`.

* `ECANCELED`  
  The operation was cancelled by the calling application.

* `EFAULT`  
  Something else went wrong. This usually indicates an internal error and is *not* supposed to happen.

Thread Safety
-------------

LibHashSet is ***thread-safe***, in the sense that all public functions operate *exclusively* on the given `hash_set_t` or `hash_map_t` instance; there is **no** implicit shared "global" state. This means that **no** synchronization is required in multi-threaded applications, provided that each instance is created and accessed only by a ***single*** thread.

However, LibHashSet does **nothing** to synchronize access to a particular `hash_set_t` or `hash_map_t` instance! Consequently, in situations where the *same* instance needs to be shared across *multiple* concurrent threads, the calling application is responsible for serializing all access to the "shared" instance, e.g. by using a [*mutex*](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/pthread_mutex_lock.html) lock!
